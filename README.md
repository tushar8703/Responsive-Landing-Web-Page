I have created a responsive Coffee landing web page. In this, some sections like header section, home section, about us section and contact have been created. 
In the header section, all the section options have been created, if you hover over it, the color of those options changes and if you click on the options, you can go to that section.
 In the home section, there is a short information about the coffee change, in the about section, the speciality of the coffee has been told, in the menu section, what kind of coffee will be available, in this, the name of the coffee product, price, and an add button have been created (if you hover over it, the color changes), and in the contact section, there is an address and an option to contact has also been created. Then, in the footer, the same options as the header have been created, if you click on it, you go to that section.  You can check the profile by going to the last one and creating some social media. 
I made this project responsive using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
